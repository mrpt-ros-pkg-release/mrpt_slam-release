Directory contains rviz-related files

Currently the \*gazebo\* rviz files refer to static topics and the user has to
manually change csldesktop to his own hostname for them to appropriately
visualize the procedure. Same goes for the \*real\* files.

There are plans to dynamically create the rviz files based on the user's hostname / current configuration using the [rviz_generator package](https://github.com/bergercookie/rviz_generator)
